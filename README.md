This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The purpose of this repository is to be able to reproduce a bug that happens with the integration of NextJs and Netlify.

## Getting Started

To start the repo you can simply run `npm install`, then make sure you have the Netlify CLI installed as a global dependenency, if not you can run `npm install netlify-cli -g`.

Once you have all the dependency installed, you can simply run `netlify dev` to test the repository.
